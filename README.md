# Neural-Style-Transfer
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

The process follows the use of VGG19 model of CNN which is used for content and style extraction features in the network.
